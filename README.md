# 🔗 **DataPltf: Relational mock data generator.

---

## 💡 The Problem:

Mock data generators are functionally limited; they only return **isolated objects**. They don't enable developers to easily create relational mock data.

To test modern applications effectively, a developer needs to generate logically **grouped and linked** objects that accurately represent user activity.

The current process of creating relational mock data is **manual, time-consuming, overwhelming, and error prone.**

## 🚀 The Solution: Interconnected Mock Data

**DataPltf** connects developers to a smart generator that goes beyond simple object creation. It **links** mock data, allowing you to **programmatically simulate** realistic user activity; with a simple api call. 

### Benefits
| Feature | Description | Potential Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stateful Provisioning** | Generate and link complex objects (users, orders, events) in a single API call, creating an authentic, interconnected scenario. | **Rapid Environment Creation:** Move from zero to a fully-populated test environment in minutes, not hours. |
| **High Test Fidelity** | Test against dynamic, realistic data that accurately simulates production complexity. | **Fewer Production Bugs:** Ensure tests cover real-world edge cases and dependency issues. |
| **Robust Customization** | Easily tweak generated data sets and configurations after the initial setup. | **Agile Testing:** Quickly adapt environments to target specific features or regression tests. |

### ⏱️ Time-to-Value

While the **initial setup requires a focused effort** to define your data schemas and linking rules, the investment pays massive dividends. Once configured, you drastically reduce the repetitive manual effort required for data seeding, ultimately **speeding up your development and QA cycles.**
